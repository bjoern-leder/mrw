functions that are defined in the *.c files listed above.


List of functions
-----------------

 void init_mrw(void)
   Initialize the structure array containing the reweighting factor
   parameter sets. This resets all previously added parameter sets.

 mrw_parms_t set_mrw_parms(int irw,mrwfact_t mrwfact,double kappa0,double kappa,
                           double mu0,double mu,double gamma,double kappa2,
                           int isp1,int isp2,int nm,int pwr,int nsrc,int tmeo)
  Sets the parameters in the reweighting factor parameter set number
  irw and returns a structure containing them (see the notes).

mrw_parms_t mrw_parms(int irw)
  Returns a structure containing the reweighting factor parameter set
  number irw (see the notes).

void read_mrw_parms(int irw)
  On process 0, this program scans stdin for a line starting with the
  string "[Reweighting factor <int>]" (after any number of blanks), where
  <int> is the integer value passed by the argument. An error occurs if
  no such line or more than one is found.

void print_mrw_parms(void)
  Prints the defined reweighting factor parameter sets to stdout on
  MPI process 0.

void write_mrw_parms(FILE *fdat)
  Writes the defined reweighting factor parameter sets to the file fdat 
  on MPI process 0.

void check_mrw_parms(FILE *fdat)
  Compares the defined reweighting factor parameter sets with those 
  on the file fdat on MPI process 0, assuming the latter were written
  to the file by the program write_mrw_parms().

mrw_masses_t get_mrw_masses(int irw,int k)
  Returns the masses of mass interpolations step k for the reweighting
  factor parameter set irw 

 complex_dble mrw1(mrw_masses_t ms,int tm,int isp,double *sqnp,double *sqne,
                  int *status)
   Generates a random pseudo-fermion field with normal distribution,
   assigns its square norm to sqne, solves the twisted-mass Dirac equation
   using the mass/twisted-mass parameters in ms, sets sqnp to the square norm
   of the solution and returns -ln(w^(1)) (see the documentation).
   The solver is specified by the parameter set number isp.
   The argument status must be pointing to an array of at least 1,1
   and 3 elements, respectively, in the case of the CGNE, SAP_GCR and
   DFL_SAP_GCR solver. On exit the array elements return the status
   values reported by the solver program.

complex_dble mrw2(mrw_masses_t ms,int tm,int *isp,complex_dble *lnw1,
                 double *sqnp,double *sqne,int *status)
   Generates a random pseudo-fermion field with normal distribution,
   assigns its square norm to sqne, solves the twisted-mass Dirac equation
   twice using the mass/twisted-mass parameters in ms, sets sqnp[0,1] to the
   square norm of the solutions, sets lnw1[0,1] to -ln(w^(1)) and returns
   -ln(w^(2)) (see the documentation).
   The solvers for the two solves are specified by the parameter set numbers
   isp[0,1].
   The argument status must be pointing to an array of at least 2,2
   and 6 elements, respectively, in the case of the CGNE, SAP_GCR and
   DFL_SAP_GCR solver. On exit the array elements return the status
   values reported by the solver program for first (first
   half of the array) and second solve (second half).

double mrw3(mrw_masses_t ms,int *isp,complex_dble *lnw1,double *sqnp,
            double *sqne,int *status)
   Generates a random pseudo-fermion field with normal distribution,
   assigns its square norm to sqne, solves the twisted-mass Dirac equation
   tree times using the mass/twisted-mass parameters in ms, sets sqnp[0,1] to the
   square norm of the first two solutions, sets lnw1[0,1] to -ln(w^(1)) and returns
   -ln(w^(4,tm)) (see the documentation).
   The solvers for the two solves are specified by the parameter set numbers
   isp[0,1].
   The argument status must be pointing to an array of at least 4,4
   and 9 elements, respectively, in the case of the CGNE, SAP_GCR and
   DFL_SAP_GCR solver. On exit the array elements return the status
   values reported by the solver program for first (first
   third of the array), second solve (second third) and third solve
   (last third).
   If ms.d1==-ms.d2 and ms.m1==ms.m2 the second solve is skipped and
   sqnp[1], lnw1[1] and status[3-5] are set to zero.

 complex_dble mrw1eo(mrw_masses_t ms,int tm,int isp,double *sqnp,double *sqne,
                  int *status)
   Generates a random pseudo-fermion field with normal distribution,
   assigns its square norm to sqne, solves the twisted-mass Dirac equation
   using the mass/twisted-mass parameters in ms, sets sqnp to the square norm
   of the solution and returns -ln(w^(1)) (see the documentation).
